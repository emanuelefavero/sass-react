# Sass (scss) in React

This is a boilerplate for using Sass (scss) in React.

## How to use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm start`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

## How to use Sass

1. Create a new file in with the extension `.scss` or `module.scss` if you want to use CSS modules
2. Import the file in your React component as you would do with a CSS file

_Personal Note: I would use css variables instead of sass variables since those works between files without the need to import them. I still find sass nesting a nice feature to use._

### Steps to reproduce this project

1. Create a new React project with `npx create-react-app project-name --template typescript`
2. Install sass `npm install sass`
3. Remove create-react-app clutter files and code
4. Add sass files to the project
